# Frontend — Open Playlist Engine

Vite · React 19 · TypeScript. A pure SPA that talks only to the backend's
OpenAPI surface — no shared code with the backend (monorepo, hard-separated).

## Develop
```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api + /health to :8000)
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

## API types
`src/api/types.ts` is hand-written for now. Once the backend is running, replace
it with a generated client:
```bash
npm run gen:api    # writes src/api/schema.d.ts from http://localhost:8000/openapi.json
```

## Flow (maps to the phased design)
1. Connect source account → 2. pick playlists/tracks → 3. connect target →
4. migrate → 5. live progress (SSE). The current scaffold wires provider
selection (`/api/providers`) and the progress stream; account/playlist steps are
stubbed pending backend implementation.
